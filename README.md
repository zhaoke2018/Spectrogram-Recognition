# Spectrogram Recognition
This is the main content of my graduation project. It can acquire spectrum(spectrogram) from RSA306B real-time spectrum analyzer. After acquisition, we can put all the training set(spectrums) into convolutional neural network which I choose Inception-v3. Acquire again, then we can test the right percent of test set(spectrum We just acquired). I also made a GUI which is convenient.

## Environment
### Hardware
1. Tektronix RSA306B real-time spectrum analyzer
### Software
1. Python 3.6.4
2. RSA API
3. TensorFlow 1.7.0
4. TensorFlow Hub

## Run
1. Open combine.py or "python combine.py"
2. Set center frequency
3. Set storage path
4. Press the "acquire" button, then we can see the real-time spectrum
5. Copy the storage path to the right side
6. Press the "test" button(about 5~10 seconds)
