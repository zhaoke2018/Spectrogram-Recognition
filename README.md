# Spectrogram Recognition
This is the main content of my graduation project. It can acquire spectrum(spectrogram) fro RSA306B real-time spectrum analyzer. After acquisition, we can put all the training set(spectrums) into convolutional neural network which I choose Inception-v3. Acquire again, then we can test the right percent of test set(spectrum We just acquired). I also made a GUI which is convenient.

There should be a GUI photo.
